topic by topic close attention to diagrams examples and definitions
Focus on critical topics such as linear and logistic regression, overfitting, gradient descent, decision trees, and KNN

**What is Machine Learning**
- Computer model that uses a lot of data to mimic intelligence
**Types of Machine Learning**
- supervised f(x) = y (labeled dataset to try and build accuracy minimize errors)
- unsupervised g(x) = z (unlabeled inputs, clusterinng try and discover groubs in data, anomaly detection, no y guiding you, little "accuracy")
- reinforcement pi(s) = a (agent intereact with environment, and by observing a state s, takes an action a, and recieves a reward r, trained to recieve a reward r as much as possible)

1. spam filtering - supervised because trained on emails labeled spam vs not spam
2. customer segmentation building clusers based on purchasing habits- unsupervised
3. robot locomotion teaching a robot to walk through trial and error. - reinforcement
4. house-price estimation -  supervised
5. image visualiztion - supervised? not supervised because no labels just finding structure in the pixels
6. game ai - reinforcement
7. network anomaly detection - unsupervised
8. handwriting recognition - supervised
9. word embeddings vector representations of words simply from text - supervised? unsupervised because no specific labels
10. drone navigation- reinforcement
