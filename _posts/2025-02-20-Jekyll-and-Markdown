# Why Learn Jekyll?

Why learn Jekyll? Well, I don’t know HTML that well. (It rhymes!) Jekyll is a simplification of HTML that integrates with GitHub Pages (what I am currently using to start my blog website). It takes Markdown and HTML files to create a static website based on my choice of layouts.

## Markdown?  

Markdown, like Liquid, is a templating language that I will need to learn more about—let me get back to you… Markdown is a “plain text formatting syntax” that converts plain text to HTML (formatted text). They say that the biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of an email.

## The .text Trick  

That was neat. The article page used to describe Markdown was made in Markdown, and they have a page showing the code/text. If, going forward, you want to view the raw Markdown source of my blogs, you can add `.text` to the end of the URL to see the Markdown source:  

`https://alex-infosex.github.io.xxxxxx.text`  

This is useful if you or I want to learn from other Jekyll blogs or understand front matter to help make our own sites.
